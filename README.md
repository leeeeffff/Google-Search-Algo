# Google-Pagerank-Algo
This project implements a PageRank algorithm, programmed in C, which is a foundational method used by search engines to rank web pages based on their importance. The program reads a collection of web pages and their links, constructs a graph representation of the connections between pages, and calculates PageRank scores for each page. Using C's efficient memory management, it builds adjacency lists to represent links, accounts for both incoming and outgoing connections, and optimizes computations by creating an auxiliary graph for incoming links. The algorithm simulates the behavior of a random web surfer, applying the damping factor and iteratively refining the ranks of pages until convergence. The results, including PageRank scores and link counts, are sorted and written to an output file. This project showcases the application of graph theory and iterative algorithms while leveraging C's low-level programming capabilities for performance optimization.
